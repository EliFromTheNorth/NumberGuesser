# NumberGuesser
JS code for a  simple game

This is a Codecademy Challegne project for creating a simple game where user is guessing a number between 0-9.
A computer is guessing the number as well and then are both guesses compared to secret target number. WhoÂ´s guess was closer to the target number, wins the round.

The HTML, CSS and the running JavaScript code was provided by Codecademy, so I am posting here only my own code for the actual game.
